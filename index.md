# About Me
---

I am currently an PhD Candidate at the School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, advised by Prof. [Xuelong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ahUibskAAAAJ). My research interest is computer vision, currently with an emphasis on image enhancement, restoration, and generation.
